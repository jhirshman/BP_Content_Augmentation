<h3 class="h3"><strong>STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">An atom is made up of a <strong>nucleus</strong> surrounded by a cloud of <strong>electrons</strong>. The nucleus contains <strong>protons</strong> and <strong>neutrons</strong> and has a positive charge because each proton carries a +1 charge and each neutron is neutral. Every electron has a &#8211;1 charge.</p>

<p class="noindentt">In an atom of an <strong>element</strong>, the sum of the positive and negative charges must be zero. If there is a net charge, the species is called an <strong>ion</strong>. Ions have more or fewer electrons than the atoms from which they are derived. The charge of an ion is written to the upper right of the symbol. A <strong>cation</strong> is positively charged. An <strong>anion</strong> is negatively charged.</p>
<p class="noindentt">The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom or ion is the <strong>atomic number</strong>. It often appears on the periodic table in red. Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, helium, 2, and so on. The neutron number cannot be determined from the periodic table.</p>
<p class="noindent">There can be different forms of an element, called <strong>isotopes</strong>, that differ in the number of neutrons in the nucleus. Isotopes exist in nature, and the percentage of each isotope in a normal sample of an element is called its <strong>natural abundance</strong>. For example, neon has three isotopes, neon-20, neon-21, and neon-22, as shown in the following table.</p>

<p class="noindent">Each isotope of an element has an exact mass that corresponds to its <strong>mass number</strong> when rounded. The <strong>mass number</strong> is the sum of the protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Thus, neon-20 has 10 protons and 10 neutrons; neon-21 has 10 protons and 11 neutrons; and neon-22 has 10 protons and 12 neutrons. The mass number is written in the upper left corner of the symbol.</p>
<p class="noindentt">The following table shows the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons for some specific isotopes, some of which have a net charge.</p>
